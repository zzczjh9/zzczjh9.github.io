Hii! I'm an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electronic and Information Engineering at Imperial College London, interested in robotics, machine learning, and optimal control

During my undergraduate studies, I am fortunate to work with [Prfs. Zhongyu Li](https://zyliatzju.github.io/) and [Prfs. Yue Wang](https://ywang-zju.github.io/) on Legged Robot and Reinforcement Learning, and intern at Lightwheel AI on Reinforcement Learning and Simulation Framework.



Find more in my [Curriculum Vitae](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf).

### Selected Projects
[View Project â†’](/projects/#genlocov2)
##### GenlocoV2: Transformer-based Generalized Locomotion Controller


Transformer-based generalized locomotion controller for morphology & topology-agnostic policy learning across diverse robotic embodiments including quadrupeds, bipeds, and humanoids. Implemented multi-robot training pipeline with procedurally generated morphological variations and novel graph-based robot representation architecture.



##### TD3 Adaptive Navigation Controller


Used the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic (TD3) algorithm to train an adaptive controller for Jackal robot, achieving major improvements in navigation. Specifically, with the DWA algorithm, the controller increased the success rate from 72% to 89.47% and cut average navigation time from 76.64 seconds to 50.92 seconds across 300 simulation worlds in Gazebo.





##### Autonomous Campus Tour Guide Robot


Award-winning autonomous robot with vision, voice, and cloud integration for campus tours. Features self-balancing mobility using dual-loop PID/LQR control achieving <15cm positional accuracy, YOLOv8 Nano vision system, cross-platform Flutter app, and RAG campus AI chat assistant.




**Languages**: Python, C++, C, SQL, SystemVerilog  
**Skills**: Isaac Sim/Gym/Lab, PyTorch, ROS, Linux, Git, Embedded Platforms (ESP/STM)
