I'm honored to have won the **Best Robotic Project Prize** at Imperial College for our second year cohort! 

Our project was an "Autonomous Campus Tour Guide Robot with Vision, Voice, and Cloud Integration" that featured:
- Self-balancing mobility using dual-loop PID/LQR control achieving <15cm positional accuracy
- YOLOv8 Nano vision system integration on RK3588
- Cross-platform Flutter app for robot control with real-time weather sensing

This recognition motivates me to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in robotics and AI!
