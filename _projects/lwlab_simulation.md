## Overview

Contributed to Lwlab, a large-scale robotics simulation framework for daily-life task training, focusing on reinforcement learning pipeline migration and humanoid robot loco-manipulation capabilities.


- **Pipeline Migration**: Migrated reinforcement learning pipelines from Isaac Lab to Lwlab's flexible configuration system
- **Multi-robot Support**: Enabled support for diverse robots including Untree G1/PandaOmron
- **Teleoperation**: Integrated VR/keyboard teleoperation capabilities
- **Scene Customization**: Implemented custom scene layout support

### Loco-manipulation Improvements

- **Velocity Tracking**: Developed velocity-tracking policies for bipedal locomotion
- **Control Decoupling**: Implemented upper/lower-body control decoupling
- **Gait Optimization**: Optimized gait stability through reward-shaping and symmetric/smoothness losses
